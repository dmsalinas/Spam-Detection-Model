Using Streamlit, an open-source python framework for creating web apps, a theoretical blockchain was created. Certain inputs enables a user to create/send blocks to mined and sent to the blockchain. There are different levels of mining difficulty with different mining times and rewards. To make sure everything is in order, the 'Validate Chain' button will return True, to confirm that the previous hash is aligned with it's corresponding block.
